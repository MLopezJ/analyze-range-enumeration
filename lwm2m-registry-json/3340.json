A write to the trigger resource or On/Off input state change starts the timing operation, and the timer remaining time shows zero when the operation is complete. The patterns supported are One-Shot (mode 1), On-Time or Interval (mode 2), Time delay on pick-up or TDPU (mode 3), and Time Delay on Drop-Out or TDDO (mode 4). Mode 0 disables the timer, so the output follows the input with no delay. A counter is provided to count occurrences of the timer output changing from 0 to 1. Writing a value of zero resets the counter. The Digital Input State resource reports the state of the timer output.\r\n        "],"ObjectID":["3340"],"ObjectURN":["urn:oma:lwm2m:ext:3340"],"LWM2MVersion":["1.0"],"ObjectVersion":["1.0"],"MultipleInstances":["Multiple"],"Mandatory":["Optional"],"Resources":[{"Item":[{"ATTR":{"ID":"5521"},"Name":["Delay Duration"],"Operations":["RW"],"MultipleInstances":["Single"],"Mandatory":["Mandatory"],"Type":["Float"],"RangeEnumeration":[""],"Units":["s"],"Description":["The duration of the time delay."]},{"ATTR":{"ID":"5538"},"Name":["Remaining Time"],"Operations":["R"],"MultipleInstances":["Single"],"Mandatory":["Optional"],"Type":["Float"],"RangeEnumeration":[""],"Units":["s"],"Description":["The time remaining in an operation."]},{"ATTR":{"ID":"5525"},"Name":["Minimum Off-time"],"Operations":["RW"],"MultipleInstances":["Single"],"Mandatory":["Optional"],"Type":["Float"],"RangeEnumeration":[""],"Units":["s"],"Description":["The duration of the rearm delay (i.e. the delay from the end of one cycle until the beginning of the next, the inhibit time)."]},{"ATTR":{"ID":"5523"},"Name":["Trigger"],"Operations":["E"],"MultipleInstances":["Single"],"Mandatory":["Optional"],"Type":[""],"RangeEnumeration":[""],"Units":[""],"Description":["Trigger initiating actuation."]},{"ATTR":{"ID":"5850"},"Name":["On/Off"],"Operations":["RW"],"MultipleInstances":["Single"],"Mandatory":["Optional"],"Type":["Boolean"],"RangeEnumeration":[""],"Units":[""],"Description":["On/off control.

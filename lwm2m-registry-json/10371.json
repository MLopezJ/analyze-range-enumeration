This is strongly recommended to use separated response for those resources (/3/0/4 and /3/0/5) and wait for response ACK before to execute/schedule the operation (reboot or reset factory). This prevents LWM2M server to consider the request as a failure in case response is lost. This situation could be annoying as server could decide to resent the request later which could bring to unexpected reboot or reset factory."]}]}}

Smaller quality levels mean that quality has decreased and the measurement has only partially passed quality check algorithms. The smaller the quality level, the more caution should be used by the application when using the measurement. When the quality level is 0 it means that the measurement should certainly be rejected."],"TS":[""],"TSLink":["0"]},{"ATTR":{"ID":"6050"},"Name":["Fractional Timestamp"],"Operations":["R"],"Type":["Float"],"RangeEnumeration":["0..1"],"Units":["s"],"Submitter":["Vaisala"],"Description":["Fractional part of the timestamp when sub-second precision is used (e.g., 0.23 for 230 ms)."],"TS":[""],"TSLink":["0"]},{"ATTR":{"ID":"6051"},"Name":["Numeric Latitude"],"Operations":["R"],"Type":["Float"],"RangeEnumeration":[""],"Units":["lat"],"Submitter":["IPSO"],"Description":["The decimal notation of latitude, e.g. -43.5723 (World Geodetic System 1984)."],"TS":[""],"TSLink":["0"]},{"ATTR":{"ID":"6052"},"Name":["Numeric Longitude"],"Operations":["R"],"Type":["Float"],"RangeEnumeration":[""],"Units":["lon"],"Submitter":["IPSO"],"Description":["The decimal notation of longitude, e.g. 153.21760 (World Geodetic System 1984)."],"TS":[""],"TSLink":["0"]},{"ATTR":{"ID":"6053"},"Name":["Numeric Uncertainty"],"Operations":["R"],"Type":["Float"],"RangeEnumeration":[""],"Units":["m"],"Submitter":["IPSO"],"Description":["The accuracy of the position in meters."],"TS":[""],"TSLink":["0"]}]}]}]}}
